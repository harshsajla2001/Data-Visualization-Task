# Data-Visualization-Task

Technologies Used: 

The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It also utilizes ECharts, a powerful visualization library, for rendering the line and bar charts.

Component Structure:

The project consists of at least two custom components: LineChart.utils.js and BarChart.utils.js, which are located in the utils directory.
The LineChart.utils.js and BarChart.utils.js components are responsible for rendering line and bar charts, respectively. They receive props such as xAxisLabel, yAxisLabel, data, and chartType to configure the charts.

Data Source:

The project imports data from the dataForChats.data.js file located in the root directory. This data is used to populate the charts with meaningful information.

Rendering:

The Charts component is the main component responsible for rendering the line and bar charts.
Inside the Charts component, instances of LineChart and BarChart components are created, each with specific configurations such as axis labels, chart type, and data.
